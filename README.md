# Txt2melody
converts text to a melody and saves it in a MIDI file
The program will convert a text into a melody and save it in a standard MIDI file, playable on any computer and importable into any MIDI enabled DAW, scoring or music production software.
Requires Python installed and the MIDIUtil library.
After downloading the latest Python version from www.python.org and installing it, add the Python directory to your PATH environment variable and install the MIDIUtil library through the following command:

pip install MIDIUtil

If you don't want to install Python, simply use the executable included.
The program will only convert lowercase and uppercase letters, ingnoring spaces and all other signs. For best results, use short texts, such as your name, your city name, your team's name or your pet's name. You can use the resulting melody as an inspiration for music composition and production.
The text must be in a file named "text.txt" and placed in the same folder of the program or the program will crash. The resulting melody will be contained in a MIDI file named "melody.mid". You can play this file through your favorite media player or import it into your favorite music program.
There's a sample text included, containing the words "Hello World". Just open the file, replace the text and save the file to generate your own melody.
